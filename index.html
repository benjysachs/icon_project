        <p>You are what you eat.</p>

        <p>From swanky fundraiser dinners to energizing snacks for staff and volunteers, food is a vital part of any campaign. The three remaining major candidates in New York’s mayoral election––Andrew Cuomo, Zohran Mamdani, and Curtis Sliwa––and Mayor Eric Adams, who recently dropped out, spent $301,163 on food over the course of the campaign so far.</p>

        <p>How each campaign spent its money on cuisine reveals a lot about the character of each candidate. With only a few weeks until voters decide the next mayor, looking at their restaurant bills can shed some light on how the candidates have been trying to court voters.</p>

        <p>Mayor Adams racked up some eye-popping tabs at exclusive members-only clubs; Sliwa made over 50 trips to diners. Cuomo, who is famously Italian (not a pervert), spent about a third of his campaign’s food-related dollars at Italian restaurants. Mamdani doubled down on snacks, spending the most of any candidate on chai, bagels, and smoothies––perhaps to feed his legion of young, scrappy volunteers.</p>

        <p>The candidates spent more on Italian food than any other type of cuisine, ringing in at over $48,000. The race’s second-most famous Italian (who is also half-Polish), Curtis Sliwa, spent $33,607. His paisan Cuomo spent $4,863 while Adams shelled out $9,628.</p>

        <p>Mayor Adams had the biggest single food-related expenditure: an event in July 2024 at the über-luxurious Le Jardin Sur Madison. This snazzy affair set his campaign back $45,839: three times more than the Cuomo campaign spent on food over the course of the whole campaign. That’s a pricey meatball!</p>

        <p>The Mamdani campaign spent $34,652 on food––only about a quarter of what Sliwa’s or Adams’ campaigns spent each. Mamdani spent the majority of this in one night. His campaign spent $19,686 on its Democratic primary victory party at The Greats of Craft, a Long Island City bar.</p>

        <p>Sliwa’s “everyday Joe” image may be more than a campaign posture. The Republican candidate’s campaign billed 51 diner meals at 22 different diners around New York City. His favorite spot was New York Luncheonette, which he has visited 11 times. However, he’s ventured out of his comfort zone to the more cosmopolitan International House of Pancakes four times.</p>
